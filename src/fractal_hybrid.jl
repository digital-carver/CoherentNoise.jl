"""
An `N`-dimensional sampler that generates a hybrid multifractal.

`N` must be an integer in the range [2, 4].

`S` may be an instance of any [`AbstractSampler`](@ref), or an un-parameterized concrete type of
one.

`O` denotes the number of octaves to apply for this fractal.

"""
    Hybrid{N}(; kwargs...)

Construct a sampler that outputs an `N`-dimensional hybrid multifractal noise when it is sampler
from.

# Arguments

  - `seed::Union{Int,Nothing}=nothing`: An integer used to seed the random number generator for this
    sampler, or `nothing`. If a seed is not supplied, one will be generated automatically which will
    negatively affect reproducibility.
  - `source::Union{Type{<:AbstractSampler},AbstractSampler}=OpenSimplex2S`: A sampler type or
    sampler instance to use as the source of the fractal. If this is an instance, its dimensionality
    must match `N`.
  - `octaves=4`: An integer between 1 and 32, denoting the number of octaves to apply.
  - `frequency=1.0`: The frequency of the first octave's signal.
  - `lacunarity=2.0`: A multiplier that determines how quickly the frequency increases for
    successive octaves.
  - `persistence=0.25`: A multiplier that determines how quickly the amplitude diminishes for
    successive octaves.
  - `args...`: Additional arguments to pass to the `source` if it is a type instead of an instance.
